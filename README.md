# Keyboard PCB Design
This is a keyboard design for a 3x3 macropad created using KiCAD software. After creating the schematic and pcb design for the macropad, the pcb was printed using prototyping services (JLCPCB). Once the pcb was received, SMD components were handsoldered to the board and tested for functionaility. THE MCU used for this project is an atmega32u4 which was programmed with a hexfile generated by [QMK_firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).
